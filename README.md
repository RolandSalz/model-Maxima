# model-Maxima
Modelling Maxima in simplified form for structural understanding and experimental purposes.

The purpose of this project is to create a model of the CAS Maxima in a simplified form in order to better understand and document its underlying structure. 

This simplified model of the real Maxima system is then also used to experiment with possible and desirable structural renovations and improvements, experiments that would be too complicated to carry out in the full Maxima system.

Comments, ideas and possibly participation, especially from Maxima developers, are welcome!
